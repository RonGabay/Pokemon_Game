# Pokemon_Game-JavaScript-
A Pokemon-like game, where the player fights against some monster with the help of 3 different buttons.
At first, you set the amount of life for the system and then start playing.
You can press a normal attack that drops the user and the monster's health randomly and a stronger hit that makes the user and the monster more vulnerable.
It is also possible at any stage to increase the life of the user, but the amount of the bar cannot be exceeded.
The user has two attempts to defeat the monster compared to the monster's one attempt, but it is set to be stronger.
The game is very visual and designed in detail.
